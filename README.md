# Plant Species Classifier 

Plant seedlings image classification with a convolutional neural network. 

## Context

The ability to differentiate between a weed and a crop seedling can mean better crop yields and better stewardship of the environment.

## Data

The Aarhus University Signal Processing group, in collaboration with University of Southern Denmark, has released a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedlings-classification) containing images of unique plants belonging to 12 species at several growth stages.
